![enter image description here](https://miro.medium.com/max/750/1*-hL6ZeXl_Kt0O-b82UQo9A.png)

Hey everyone! In this article I’m going to show you how to go from knowing  _little to nothing_  about Web Development to  _Junior Full Stack Developer_  in just  **six months,**  **for**  **under $30**.

This article will cover everything you need to know! You’ll first learn the basics of Web Development with an online coding bootcamp (**$15**). You’ll follow that up with an advanced bootcamp (**$15**). Then, we’ll jump into free tutorials, articles, and documentation where you will reinforce everything you’ve learned in the first two bootcamps. Next, you’ll build a few projects with your new skills and open-source them on GitHub. Finally, we’ll focus on resume creation, interview preparation, and salary negotiation.

# **Here’s what you’ll learn if you follow this guide:**

-   **HTML/CSS**
-   **jQuery**
-   **JavaScript**
-   **Git/Version Control**
-   **React**
-   **Node.js**
-   **MongoDB**

**Ready? Lets dive in.**

# #1.  [The Web Development Bootcamp](http://bit.ly/2yEYsoB)

First thing’s first — You need to learn the basics and build a solid foundation of web development principles. There are many ways to do this, but in my opinion, this is the  **best**  and  **easiest**  way.

Colt Steele’s Web Development Bootcamp is the single best web development course money can buy. It’s sometimes on sale for $20 or less, and it’s packed with more than 40 hours of on-demand content.

Colt Steele, the instructor, was a lead instructor at a coding bootcamp in San Fransisco before moving to online coding education. This course is the online equivalent of what he taught at his in-person bootcamp.

_This course covers all of the web dev basics:_  **HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap,** SemanticUI, DOM Manipulation,  **jQuery,** Unix(Command Line) Commands

_Once you’ve got the basics down, you’ll explore more advanced topics like:_ **NodeJS,** NPM,  **ExpressJS,** REST,  **MongoDB,** Database Associations,  **Authentication,** PassportJS, and Authorization.

Colt not only knows web development, but almost more importantly, he knows how to teach it. He clearly explains tougher concepts and breaks everything down in the easy to handle chunks. Plus, the course revolves around projects, so you learn by building real-world things, not boring reading and test taking.

# #3. Reinforce your Skills

At this point, you’ve taken two online coding bootcamps and you’re hopefully starting to feel comfortable with your web development skills. You can successfully take a simple idea and build it out beautifully using a Node.js backend, and React on the front-end. Plus, you’re confident in your CSS abilities to style out a mobile first, responsive page.

Now it’s time to continue learning while  **reinforcing**  your new skills. Below is a list of documentation, articles, and tutorials.

Reading these a few months ago probably would’ve made no sense — but with your new skills you can handle them like a champ.
